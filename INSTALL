Ideally, you should be able to just type:

./configure
make
make install


For Kali Linux, you might also need to do:

apt install libssl1.0-dev

It needs an older SSL version due to OpenSSH code for the SSH module.


For Ubuntu, you might also need to add the -lrt flag to the LDFLAGS variable in the Makefile, 
if you get the undefined reference to `clock_gettime' error:

LDFLAGS = -Lnbase -Lnsock/src -Lopensshlib $(DBGFLAGS) $(STATIC) -lrt
